          | Upon returning from a business trip to London Brian and Jeremy met a kind,
          |  single mother living in New York City trying to make ends meet.
          |  She was inspired by the prospect of bringing in some desperately needed income by becoming a professional rideshare driver,
          |  but was struggling to find a vehicle to rent and drive. Unfortunately,
          |  this agonizing process of renting for-hire vehicles is stuck in the 1930s when it first began.
          |  It has yet to adapt with improvements in safety and efficiency that technology has brought to other parts of our lives.

        p
          | Idle Cars is improving the efficiency, safety, and access of renting for-hire vehicles to millions of people, globally.
          |  With the ongoing “reversal of the suburban exodus”, the world’s population will be faced with the
          |  problem of utilize idle assets more efficiently. We will be forced to leverage the idle cars,
          |  which remain parked for long blocks of time when other drivers are not on the clock.
        br
        p Idle Cars provides the tools to participate in the on-demand revolution.
